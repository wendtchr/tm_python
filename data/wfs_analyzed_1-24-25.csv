352-A Submission through Regulations.gov from Katherine Aaron 9-17-2024.pdf,,,,,9/17/2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Katherine Aaron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Since a chemical exposure in 1983 I've suffered from asthma. My husband has been diagnosed with COPD and asthma. Fortunately, we are retired and stay indoors with medical grade HEPA filtration systems when the wildfire smoke blows our way, otherwise we would be in the ER. So I am very concerned about this important topic. Thank you for addressing this fast-growing issue and the needs of working Americans. I'm concerned that there isn't anything in your report regarding funding for studies regarding damage to the respiratory system in workers exposed to wildfire smoke and particulate matter. In my opinion this is a glaring oversight since the frequency and severity of our wildfires out west are only going to increase. I think it's imperative to understand the dangers that workers are exposed to. Otherwise how can they make the informed consent to expose themselves or not. Not even knowing how much less, or none, permanent damage between using PPEs or not requires knowledge before they can even make a choice. We need to know how wildfires impact not only respiratory health but does it have a long term danger of cancer or other diseases? Unless disease correlations are studied and known, it will be the injured workers, their insurance companies, and welfare (tax payers) paying for damaged lives and bodies when they could have been avoided all together. The studies will provide this much needed knowledge. It's a glaring omission.",,,,,,,,health hazards

As the wildfires become more frequent, the smoke creates dangerous working conditions that can lead to serious health issues. In my view, we need to take action immediately to protect these hard-working labor workers. According to the NIOSH Hazard Review, it states that, ""Scientific studies suggest PM2.5 can cause heart, lung, and 18 other health problems, as well as death”(11). This has emphasized how short-term working conditions that have daily exposures to dangerous smokes can have long-term effects on the outdoor workers who work without any kind of safety precautions when wildfire occurs. Furthermore, I believe that we must improve the air quality/filters in buildings so these workers can have a safe & healthy environment where they can stay to rest to prevent damage to their health. Next, all workers should be trained and informed when it gets unsafe outside, their rules about how to proceed, and work rotations & time limit on how much they can work in conditions. Finally, all workers should be provided with good personal protective equipment like the N95 masks to be more cautious when air quality gets worse.

They should be able to take shifts between workers to avoid being exposed to unhealthy air for long periods of time. It's one thing to protect people from the air but it could be further prevented by trying to stop wildfires and air pollution.

If outdoor workers experience long periods of exposure to smoke, it is necessary to provide filtered air for them. If fire and smoke worsen, administrative control should be done to control the situation better by educating their workers and being prepared. For administrative control, workers can rotate between shifts and there should be a reduction in work intensity. The last option in case of a fire should be PPE to be used.

352-A Submission through Regulations.gov from Zander Huston 12-13-2024,,,,,12/13/2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Zander Huston,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We write in response to the request for public comment on the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) draft Hazard Review: Wildland Fire Smoke Exposure Among Farmworkers and Other Outdoor Workers (CDC-2024-0065; NIOSH-352-A). We study the impacts of environmental health hazards and threats based on focus group research conducted with farmworkers in Oregon’s Willamette Valley. Questions one, five, six, and seven, to which NIOSH requested responses, are most relevant to our expertise and inform our public comment. Given our research focus, the present response will address farmworkers, but may also apply to other relevant populations.

We are pleased with NIOSH’s inclusion of a health equity analysis in section 2.4. The draft hazard review correctly identifies specific barriers farmworkers encounter, including social hierarchies’ harmful effects on health outcomes. The interactions between documentation status, exclusion from regulatory purview (e.g. exemption for agricultural workers in labor law), exclusion from social services based on documentation status or language access, workplace power dynamics related to socially constructed hierarchies, undercounting/under-researching vulnerable populations, subcontracting, language/literacy differences, the piece-rate system, and the other aspects of farmworkers’ social conditions that are described in the draft hazard review are essential to understand who is affected by smoke exposure and why. 

This characterization of farmworkers’ exposure could be improved by discussing the economic factors that influence their exposure to wildland fire smoke. The hazard review already mentions, in passing, healthcare access is limited by circumstances of poverty and ineligibility for subsidies. Low wages and other factors that cause economic precarity profoundly increase exposure and the burden of environmental hazards. Agricultural workers we interviewed describe routinely working in 115-degree weather with thick smoke during harvest season. For example, a participant described how “yo sentía en mis ojos que me caía como arenita, como no sé, tierra, o sea, todo el humo que estaba. Entonces es muy, muy peligroso salir también cuando está así” [I would feel all the smoke in my eyes that was falling on me like bits of sand or, I don’t know, dirt. So, it is very, very dangerous to go out when it is like this]. Farmworkers are aware that working in such conditions is dangerous to their health. Yet, many risk exposure, even acute and long-term health risks at the workplace, to secure groceries and rent. Another participant noted, “if there isn’t work…there isn’t [money] for the rent. And that is the main thing – the rent… because if you don’t pay, they kick you out.”  These competing priorities — safety and income — are essential to understanding and ameliorating farmworkers’ exposure to smoke. Meaningfully addressing the barriers farmworkers face in mitigating the risks of wildfire smoke exposure requires analysing and addressing the economic barriers workers face to reduce smoke exposure.

One of the research priorities correctly identified in section 6.4 relates to the barriers to implementing health and safety programs that protect farmworkers. Some research, including findings from the Michigan Farm Worker Project, has begun to address this question, emphasizing the role that workplace power dynamics and financial pressures play in inhibiting workplace safety.1  One study already cited in the draft hazard review found, using focus group interviews with farm workers, that themes such as “killing yourself to make a living” and “economic vulnerability” are important to understanding farmworkers’ health concerns.2 Disparate incentives between employer and employees and weak government enforcement often lead to businesses violating migrant workers’ safety protections.3 When this occurs, workers have to decide whether or how to balance their competing priorities. Poverty wages pressure farmworkers’ decision-making process when determining to continue working in hazardous environments.

Recommendations presented in the draft hazard review rely on employers committing to adoption (in the context of both legally mandated – like Oregon – and voluntary measures) of measures like work relocation, worker rotation, length/intensity reduction shifts, work-rest cycles, and providing information in accessible languages and formats (which is especially important for the indigenous farmworker populations who speak a variety of languages4). In addition to these strategies, it should be added that employers modify the pay system (the perverse incentive of the piece-rate compensation is already outlined in section 2.4.4) and the wage scale to encourage safe decisions from farmworkers under the administrative controls paradigm. 

Historically, inattentive employers to worker needs have been met with pressure from workers themselves, governmental agencies, labor groups, advocacy organizations, and other stakeholders.5 This is evidence that recommendations without rules and enforcement will be of limited relevance and protection to farmworker populations. For example, workers we interviewed indicated that even basic occupational requirements, such as hand washing stations and shaded areas, were not provided by employers. These are sanitary and safety conditions already legally mandated in Oregon. The draft recommendations note that the employer cannot feasibly make all changes immediately due to short harvest time frames, labor market conditions, and other factors. However, employees also have constraints around their family life, health concerns, and other personal and social needs. Flexibility for employers (often centered around maintaining production) is often a contradictory goal from employee flexibility (often related to family/social obligations, pace of work, and workplace safety).6 In this context, it would be worthwhile to make recommendations for when employer and employee interests diverge in the context of wildfire smoke exposure. It would be appropriate for NIOSH to mention the utility of government regulation and enforcement to promote safe workplace practices that reduce wildfire smoke exposure, even when it contradicts employers’ production goals.

Farmworkers we have interviewed care deeply about minimizing health risks in the workplace when they are in control. Often, they are forced to make the best out of exploitative and abusive conditions and are pressured to engage in unsafe work practices and refrain from reporting health concerns (including through threat of firing or deportation).7 As written currently, the draft hazard does not adequately account for the common and powerful barriers to implementing the recommendations. Additional recommendations could be added to the hazard review to target alternative actors. Possibilities include:


1. Broadening many of the recommendations in section 5.2.2.1 and elsewhere beyond being addressed to employers. The relevant actors should be expanded to include worker organizations, government, advocacy organizations, and other groups who may influence workplace safety practices. This should include recommendations that appropriate actions like employer provision of PPE and inclement weather leave be codified into law and enforced.
2. Augmenting section 5.1.2.3 to recommend employers and social service providers promote increased access to sufficient air conditioning, showers, insulation, air filtration, and washing and drying machines (the importance of which are already described in section 2.4.5).8
3. Adding more details to section 5.2.2.3, emphasizing to healthcare professionals that some populations may have additional barriers to accessing medical services (described in the health equity section9), requiring special efforts to best provide care to farm workers. Our research indicates that farmworkers may perceive medical professionals negatively because their health concerns are dismissed. Additionally, it should be noted that farmworkers' health concerns related to repetitive labor and exposures to hazardous pollutants are often mischaracterized as stress.
4. Recommending actions that positively influence workers’ decision-making matrix toward avoiding unnecessary smoke exposure by reducing poverty, increasing the availability of social services, and reducing power imbalances between employers and employees. For example, farm worker climate change funds – similar to what was temporarily established in Oregon’s Senate Bill 556110 – could provide financial relief to vulnerable populations at high risk of exposure to wildfire smoke. Additionally, recommendations could be made for increased wages and overtime pay.
To summarize, we recommend that 1) the economic factors influencing farmworker exposure to wildfire smoke be more fully incorporated into Chapter 2 and 2) the health equity analysis be integrated into the recommendations by better addressing relevant actors who are not employers. Thank you for considering this input.

As a Doctor of Public Health specializing in occupational health and safety, I bring extensive experience in research focused on the health impacts of wildland fire smoke exposure, particularly among wildland firefighters. My dissertation research examined critical issues such as chemical risk knowledge, respiratory protection practices, and the differences in safety perceptions between leadership and non-leadership personnel within
the firefighting community. I have been involved in wildland firefighter health and safety research since 2014, collaborating with organizations such as The Wildfire Conservancy to investigate the barriers to effective respiratory protection and the knowledge gaps surrounding chemical exposures. My expertise is highly relevant to the current NIOSH draft hazard review on wildland fire smoke exposure among farmworkers and outdoor workers. The insights gained from my research can be directly applied to address similar challenges faced by farmworker populations, who often encounter prolonged exposure to wildfire smoke, limited access
to respiratory protection, and inequities in safety practices. I am providing recommendations based on my findings that aim to bridge these gaps and enhance the health and safety measures for all outdoor workers at risk.
Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this important review. I look forward to sharing evidence-based suggestions informed by my research experience and collaborating to improve protective measures for  vulnerable worker populations.",,,,,,,,comment only

Additionally, the absence of a dedicated respiratory protection standard for wildland firefighters exacerbates these challenges.
• Recommendation: Develop a consistent respiratory protection program that ensures RPE, such as N95 respirators, is available on-site at all times, not just during wildfire emergencies.

How could the outdoor worker populations who may be exposed to wildland fire smoke be more completely characterized in Chapter 2? Please provide supporting references.

Research into the effects of occupational exposure to wildfire smoke outside of the wildfire firefighter population remains limited, and even data-based estimates of potential workers exposed has significant limitations, due to the patterns of seasonal work, precarious or temporary employment and inherent worker vulnerability present within many of the worker groups with significant outdoor work duties, particularly the agricultural worker population.

We strongly echo the need for further research to understand the health impacts of occupational air pollution exposure in agricultural and construction worker populations. Additionally, as the document addressed, self-employed workers are not captured in these estimates. These workers may also face significant exposure to outdoor air pollution. Postal and delivery workers often lack air conditioning and have frequent stops, leading them to keep open doors regardless of smoke (National Association of Letter Carriers, 2023). Estimating the number of potential workers faces challenges due to the increasing use of independent contractors or “gig workers”. These workers in particular face significant challenges to advocate for improved workplace safety, and also have financial incentives to minimize delays in their route. This may contribute to higher levels of ambient air pollution exposure, and increased negative health consequences.

Similarly, while not the specific target of this proposal, even workers characterized as “indoor workers” may face significant exposure to wildfire smoke in the workplace. A study of childcare facilities across British Columbia identified significantly higher indoor PM2.5 concentrations during wildfire events (Lee et al. Environmental Health Research 2024, PMID 34574730). For facilities such as packing or processing plants where outside doors are typically left open to provide ventilation and reduce heat, these exposures may be significantly higher.",,,,,,,,exposures

How could this document better identify and characterize the health hazards of exposures to wildland fire smoke based on the available scientific literature in Chapter 3? Is there additional scientific information to be considered regarding the adverse health endpoints associated with exposure to wildland fire smoke? Please provide scientific references to support your response as necessary.

While this document accurately summarizes the current scientific literature around the health hazards of wildfire smoke, there remains a significant dearth of research directly focused on the impact of wildfire smoke on worker health. Outdoor workers, particularly those working physically active jobs, may have respiratory rates (and subsequent minute ventilation) significantly higher than the indoor population. Given this, exposure to harmful air pollutants and subsequent health effects may also be significantly higher. It remains unclear whether the Air Quality Index, which was developed based on health studies in the general population, accurately reflects the health hazards for outdoor worker groups.

352-A Submission through Regulations.gov from Irina Petrache 12-19-2024,,,,,12/19/2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Irina Petrache/ American Thoracic Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3. What additional information should NIOSH consider adding or how should NIOSH modify the discussion of exposure assessment methods for wildland fire smoke (based on PM2.5 airborne concentration, and when desired, other airborne exposures) to measure outdoor worker exposures in Chapter 4? What are the barriers to employers to implement these recommended methods? Please provide scientific evidence to support your response as necessary.

The use of a tiered system for wildfire smoke assessment is logical and each tier is well described. For Tier 3 exposures, the Teixeira et al 2024 study (PMID: 38922102) on exposure could be helpful in comparing methods of metalloid measurement (see NIOSH Appendix C3) and may be helpful in expanding the discussion on exposures during prescribed burns (Section 5.1).

To help the reader visualize this three tiered approach, a figure may be helpful. This 3 tiered approach would easily fit within a pyramid structure with a broad base of sensors at Tier 1 moving up to the peak of the pyramid in tier 3 with the most specific monitoring equipment.

In 4.4.1.1 Models, it would be reasonable to consider a ‘land use’ variable in the model to account for human made structures in the areas (warehouses, residential homes, mines, superfund sites or other unique features).

For Table 4-3, satellite technology is rapidly advancing, including the newest Tropospheric Emissions:Monitoring of Pollution ‘TEMPO’ satellite mission (https://tempo.si.edu/data_for_public.html). The mission of TEMPO is to “allow unprecedented monitoring of air quality down to neighborhood scales, with its hourly daytime scans over North America.” Reference is: https://science.nasa.gov/learningresources/
science-activation/new-tempo-cosmic-data-story-makes-air-quality-data-publicly-available The data are publicly available so could be an easy way to get near real time data over the period of exposure.

Finally, we would recommend clarification about what ultrafine particles are, such as in 4.2 Lines 5-9 below:
“PM2.5 as the Primary Indicator of Exposure: As described in Chapter 2, wildland fire smoke contains a wide variety of airborne contaminants, including particulate matter of various sizes. It contains ultrafine particles (particles with a diameter less than 100 nm or 0.1 ?m), which is a constituent of fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles smaller than 2.5 ?m diameter) and coarse particle matter (PM10, particles smaller than 10 ?m diameter). Elemental and organic carbon (both primary and secondary) are present in wildfire smoke as well.”

The barriers to employers to implement these methods are in part the difficulty in moving from very simple, readily accessible measures in Tier 1 to the more intensive measures in Tier 2 and Tier 3. Trying to track locations of firefighters could be difficult in the mountain regions. Heterogeneity in measurements may create an equity issue if one employer measures up to Tier 3, but others settle for Tier 1 (the group that measures the Tier 3 may appear to have worse exposure than the group that only measures Tier 1 despite exposures being equal).",,,,,,,,exposures

How can the recommendation in Chapter 4 to use the air quality index (AQI) for PM2.5 to define exposure control categories be better explained and supported from both a scientific and health communications standpoint? Please provide scientific evidence to support your response as necessary.

The AQI is a good choice to pair with the exposure categories as it is an evidence-based resource offered through the US government and is updated and maintained regularly. The NowCast component of the Air Now program (https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-01/documents/nowcastfactsheet.pdf) may be a more responsive metric to track as it uses a 12-hour rolling average rather than the general AQI's use of 24 hour average of the preceding day[DC5] . That said there will still be a lagging effect of the NowCast underestimating these pollution levels during the early (increasing) phase and overestimating the effect during the resolution phase of the pollution peak.",,,,,,,,exposures

What additional information should NIOSH consider to improve the strategies identified in Chapter 5 for controlling exposure to wildland fire smoke (e.g.,engineering controls, work practices, personal protective equipment) to make them more effective and reduce barriers to implementation? What additional controls could be considered to protect outdoor workers from wildland fire smoke? Please provide scientific evidence to support your response as necessary.

Monitoring of effectiveness is of particular importance, to assure that hazards are effectively mitigated during smoke events. Low-cost sensors may play an increasingly prominent role in such monitoring networks, and are mentioned in Chapter 5. Validity of various monitors is under investigation by a number of academic institutions, with some developing correction factors as needed to improve precision of measurement. Recommendations regarding monitoring technologies and degree of transparency in reporting (i.e. to workers, public) should be addressed.

352-A Submission through Regulations.gov from Irina Petrache 12-19-2024,,,,,12/19/2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Irina Petrache/ American Thoracic Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Regarding indoor filtration, electrostatic precipitators are mentioned, and though effectively reducingPM2.5, they generally produce ozone as a byproduct. This may be of particular concern with portable air cleaners located directly in the space with workers. As ozone is a respiratory irritant with independent health implications, particularly among those with susceptibility (overlapping with those who have sensitivity to wildfire smoke), HEPA filters are generally preferred from a health perspective, when available, to avoid introduction of ozone into a space. Resources for optimizing choice of air filtration are available through organizations such as the California Air Resources Board (Hazardous Ozone- Generating Air Purifiers | California Air Resources Board), and providing considerations for employers on vetting of any new technologies/engineering controls implemented for air filtration is ideal.

Regarding creating an effective cleaner air space inside of a vehicle, education of workers regarding the use of recirculate mode during smoky conditions is important. An emphasis on not only cleaner air, but temperature controlled air (air conditioning access) should be emphasized. Might increased frequency of vehicle filter checks and servicing for safety (noting the mention of potential for hazards) be considered?

Further clarification around the statement “Using new approaches, as well as using existing buildings or vehicles as a cleaner air refuge, needs to be fully assessed before implementation” should be provided. To whom does the duty of this assessment fall? The employer? And what constitutes assessment? Is this air monitoring?

We very much appreciate the notation regarding co-exposure to/consideration of heat, given overlap in exposures and emerging evidence suggesting the potential for synergistic health effects.",,,,,,,,engineering controls
352-A Submission through Regulations.gov from Irina Petrache 12-19-2024,,,,,12/19/2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Irina Petrache/ American Thoracic Society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"6. Do the recommendations in Chapter 5 adequately address the protection of potentiallydisadvantaged or at-risk outdoor workers, such as persons with pre-existing health conditions (e.g.,asthma, cardiovascular disease), migrant workers, persons of lower socioeconomic status, and elderly or minor workers? If not, how could the recommendations be changed to better protect these populations? Are there additional recommendations to consider to protect these at-risk workers?

Table 5-1 suggests a tiered approach for mitigation activities, with “sensitive” workers recommended to receive intervention at a lower threshold of the AQI. While this reflects public health guidance, the identification of sensitive workers may be problematic in the setting of economic and power imbalance. Without protections from loss of wages or employment as a result of these sensitivities there is a disincentive for employees to report these conditions for receipt of protections (for example, among migrant worker populations on hourly wages).

Further, we would urge NIOSH to consider sensitive populations as not only those with a predefined disease but those who report symptoms upon exposure to wildfire smoke, suggesting a need to access cleaner air. Note that this issue is raised in Section 5.3.2, and would be important to also highlight in Table 5-1.

Given emerging data regarding short and longer term risks of wildfire smoke exposures, and the possibility for future revision of public health guidance in accordance with this data, we would encourage NIOSH to consider noting that in the event of updates reflecting more stringent thresholds of PM2.5 or AQI, these more stringent threshold should be applied to the recommendations in Table 5.1 unless otherwise stated by NIOSH.

Purchasing of appropriate engineering controls is recommended but determination of appropriateness is not further defined in this section. For many outdoor workers (including some of the most vulnerable, such as farmworkers) engineering controls will not apply, and administrative controls may not be broadly feasible. Even if instituted, workers whose wages are dependent on productivity/hours worked will be disproportionately affected financially, creating further disparities unless equitable policies surrounding wage loss in the face of wildfire smoke events are provided and enforced.

Fit-testing of PPE is recommended, however further specificity around frequency of testing and respirator replacement is not provided. As respirator use is likely to feature highly among those who are unable to realistically receive engineering or administrative controls, an updated consideration of these parameters is recommended. The current text references the OSHA 1998 Respiratory Protection Standard, however with the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a surge in research related to fit testing and respiratory durability, including in a recently published article in JAMA (doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.53631), which in total may further inform respiratory protection recommendations. For those who cannot achieve an adequate fit (due to facial structure or facial hair, the latter of which may be personal preference or of cultural/religious significance), could NIOSH provide some guidance around recourse (ie PAPR?) to prevent discrimination?",,,,,,,,hierarchy of controls - multiple

How could the recommendations in Chapter 5 better address accessibility and feasibility for outdoor workers and employers?

The meaning of these key takeaways are not clear and should be explained better: Elimination should be practiced using wildland management to reduce the likelihood of wildland fires. Substitution is not applicable for wildland fire events. Later in the document, elimination is defined as physically remove the hazard, and substitution is defined as replace the hazard. 

Additionally, it’s not clear how people should actually implement the recommendations. For example, in the key takeaway that respirators can protect again inhalation of hazardous material, is the recommendation that employers be required to supply them? Similarly, for the takeaway that workers should be allowed to seek medical care if they experience signs/symptoms of injury, does this adequately address the plight of the workers, not all of whom have available sick time to do this?

On page 240, the article cites Austin et al 2021 that examined co-exposure of heat and poor air quality. There is limited discussion about how workers’ health suffer as a result of co-exposure to both heat and poor air quality but this is an important consideration and a reality that will only worsen with climate change.

On page 241, the article recommends employers identify workers who are considered high-risk but does not address the issue of patient confidentiality or how employees should be protected if they disclose a medical condition that puts them at high risk (ex asthma). 

Throughout the chapter, the recommendations are based on AQI levels but the AQI is based on previous 24 hour averages. It’s important to bring in the concept of using air quality forecasts so that exposure can be mitigated before it occurs, not after. Because wildfires can cause short-lived spikes in smoke, the window to protect workers might have already passed using previous 24 hour averages. The bullet points describing responsibilities of the worker and employer are good because it should be a combined effort to ensure the health of the workers.

What are the potential barriers to the understandability of the recommendations in Chapter 5 for outdoor workers and employers?

Some of the language is not defined in the key takeaways. If people do not understand the key takeaways, that significantly limits the utility of the document. We’d suggest making these key takeaways as accessible to the public as possible.

Responding to NIOSH’s first specific question in the Request for Public Comment,2 the Draft Hazard Review should include discussion of pregnant workers (who are more sensitive to the effects of wildland fire smoke) and indoor workers (who may also experience exposure to and health effects from wildland fire smoke).

The below discussion responds to NIOSH’s question: “How could outdoor worker populations who may be exposed to wildland fire smoke be more completely characterized in Chapter 2?”4

Pregnant workers. As I explain in Pregnant Workers and the Climate Crisis, “[p]regnant workers are particularly vulnerable because they are more sensitive to health effects from wildfire smoke.”5 Indeed, “[i]nhalation rates are estimated to be higher during pregnancy and the postpartum period.”6 And lest some claim that pregnant workers are not among outdoor workers, note that “women . . . comprise a quarter of all U.S. agricultural workers,”7 and that, tragically, outdoor pregnant worker María Isabel Vásquez Jiménez died after exposure to another environmental health risk (excessive heat).8 

The Draft Hazard Review therefore should recognize pregnant workers as a worker population of concern. For instance, under Section 2.4 on “Health Equity,”9 the Draft Hazard Review could include discussion of pregnant workers as a worker population of concern and explain particular risks that pregnant workers face.

In summer 2023, unprecedented wildland fire smoke swept into the East Coast and Midwest from Canada, showing that wildland fire smoke is no longer a regional problem, but instead one that the entire country must grapple with.12 Then again this past fall, wildland fires in New York and New Jersey erupted after a drought, and smoke engulfed New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.13

To prevent employers from previously unaffected regions from discarding risks associated with wildland fire smoke, the Draft Hazard Review should include a discussion explaining that this hazard can now be present nationwide.

The use of the EPA PM scale is beneficial, however, please consider how wildland smoke differs from PM, especially in the oncogenic arena. Once calculations have been made (possibly an Excess Cancer Risk Assessment) – it’s possible to back calculate so those in the field can use the EPA AQ scale.

As described by the EPA, the size of particles affects the potential to cause health effects. PM2.5 is considered to be the greatest risk for worker exposure. PM2.5 designates particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. Particles from smoke tend to be very small, with a size range near the wavelength of visible light (0.4–0.7 micrometers).
Given the range of the wildland smoke particle size, it may be beneficial to include a discussion about the particulate filtration efficiency of NIOSH approved particulate respirators. Specifically, NIOSH tests filtration efficiency at a most penetrating particle size (MPPS). Particle size variants larger and smaller than the tested MPPS are captured at a greater efficiency.
Previous NIOSH NPPTL research and presentations explain particulate capture technology even extending to nano size particles.

The document discussions addressing respiratory protection are both trite and pithy. Readers of the document will likely believe that a NIOSH approved N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) is the NIOSH preferred respirator used for inhalation protection from PM2.5 wildland fire smoke. While the N95 FFR can be used for protection, there are other particulate respirator configurations that provide the needed inhalation protection.
Appropriate respiratory protection technology for the PM2.5 wildland fire smoke hazard is a NIOSH approved particulate respirator selected using the OSHA Assigned Protection Factor (APF) to achieve a NIOSH ECC 2 level of inhalation hazard. Particulate filtration can be any NIOSH approved efficiency with an N, R or P series rating. The respirator can be a filtering facepiece respirator, an elastomeric ¼ mask, elastomeric ½ mask, full facepiece, hood or a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR).
While the appropriate technical description for respiratory protection may seem to be overly complex, recent experience with supply shortages of N95 FFRs due to COVID justifies the need to utilize the full range of NIOSH approved respirators that meet the protective needs of PM2.5 exposure.
The OSHA APF table includes the entire range of face coverings (1/4, 1/2, full, hood and PAPR) and NIOSH approvals exist for a range of filtration efficiencies at N, R, and P series rating.",,,,,,,,ppe

The document clearly states only inhalation hazards are addressed. However, some information addressing other routes of exposure would be worthwhile to consider. Dermal and ocular exposures do occur and can be problematic even though they do not have the potential to transmit into the blood stream as with inhalation hazards.
In particular, work in a wildland fire smoke workplace potentially exposes the ocular surface directly to PM2.5 which can lead to ocular diseases. (Reference: Consequences of exposure to particulate matter on the ocular surface: Mechanistic insights from cellular mechanisms to epidemiological findings, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38311159/ ).
Additional information on potential ocular diseases resulting from exposure is discussed in the following publication:
Impact on Eye Health Regarding Gaseous and Particulate Pollutants, https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-20-03-fc-0098.
While sufficient information on ocular exposure may not exist to categorize exposure levels to fit the NIOSH ECC levels, it may be worthwhile to recommend the use of protective eyewear when working in any level of exposure.
Similarly, dermal exposure will occur when working in a wildland smoke environment. Again, it may be worthwhile to recommend that covering exposed skin areas with clothing can be helpful.
Since the ocular and dermal particulate exposure research may not be as robust as inhalation research, a limited discussion could be added as an appendix to the Hazard Review. Inclusion of dermal and ocular information would make the NIOSH Hazard Review: Wildland Fire Smoke Exposure Among Farmworkers and Other Outdoor Workers a complete wildland fire exposure resource for worker protection.",,,,,,,,exposures

NIOSH should consider including a discussion about respirator selection and, include a discussion that selection and use of a particulate respirator may not be appropriate to address all hazards associated with wildfire events. Although PM2.5 is considered to be the greatest wildfire event risk, other exposure hazards may be present. Workplace location relative to the wildfire source and the presence of other non-wildfire hazards may require protection. This consideration is especially important for non-first responder outdoor work such as assessing the event, clean-up, and other support activities. NIOSH has established guidance regarding respirator selection that can be used in these situations.",,,,,,,,ppe

In Section 2.4, the health equity issues that pertain to farmworkers could be expanded:
Farmworkers are at the forefront of climate-related emergencies: as outdoor workers, they are among the first to encounter extreme weather conditions, including heat and wildfire smoke. Their employment conditions—e.g., low wages, piece work, no employment benefits, visa requirements, reliance on employer-provided housing and transportation-- often make it impossible for them to protect themselves.

1) Elimination strategy: Using wildland management to reduce the likelihood of wildfires. Guidelines for correct management.
• A comment about this strategy is about the challenge in how to develop this management. For the state and county level it may be optimal to generate federal guidelines and standards of how wildfires programs should be designed and evaluated, and even what elements should be considered for its correct functioning. For example, it is important to include in the wildfire management a logic of working across departments, in which natural resources administration, industrial compliance, emergency response, transport administration, and urban planning can be interconnected and have mutual and permanent feedback. This logic has been already applied at the National Interagency Fire Center with an on-the-ground firefight effort perspective. Nonetheless, it is favorable to have an interagency workgroup within the state government structures that address and prevent wildfire with a comprehensive approach. Moreover, land management should be applied in private facilities, especially considering that farm work involves extensive lands under the ownership of a private enterprise. The land management should be within the daily activities of the company and be considered in the performance assessment, internalized as a program, which state authorities should evaluate. Both private programs and state evaluations would require general guidelines to be correctly developed. A good precedent is the sustainable land management practices recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), which has an ecosystemic approach and targets both the public and private sectors, providing best practices for the Integrated Land Management (ILM) including fire control and land cover after fire (M.J. Sanz et al, 2017).",,,,,,,,hierarchy of controls - multiple

Recommendations specifically for wildland fire exposure:
• It would be good to have general recommendations about the distribution of these facilities and devices per surface and quantity of workers in the companies. In addition, a recommendation on the spatial distribution of these elements should be provided according to the type of workflow each outdoor workplace has, accessibility, and predicted level of exposure. Despite existing recommendations for this topic (p.71,74, 237-240 of the report), the complexity of wildland fire exposure requires a special analysis, that includes the fact that workers are not only highly exposed at the workplace but may be highly exposed in their communities too due to take-home route and environmental exposure. These make for constant exposure especially considering that many outdoor workers live near their workplace. For example, many farmworkers live in employer-provided housing (Grzywacz, J. G. et al., 2010), which is generally in the proximity of the farms. Considering this cumulative effect, the engineering controls should be stricter, carefully checked by safety officers, and inspected by authorities with specific standards and recommendations.",,,,,,,,engineering controls

• For the education and training of workers, it must be a challenge to include wildland fire smoke as a new hazard within the already existing training programs. NIOSH has developed a very useful description (p. 3-10, 42-51, 73-77, 166-172 of the report) of the hazard and provides tools to characterize it and predict exposures, but it would be good to have a protocol that explains how to include this hazard in the educational activities.

It would be useful to get a theoretical framework and a recommended method. The objective of this assessment would be to get to know the population, their needs and requirements.
By doing this, it can help also to gain farmworkers’ trust in terms of putting the safety officer of the company and the corresponding state authorities in a role of trust, which helps to improve the communication and to have reliable information from the workers. Also, this approach can be included in the recommendations of how to define Similar Exposure Groups (SEG) (p. 204 of the report). ",,,,,,,,exposures

In response to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s (NIOSH) request for comments on the draft Hazard Review – Wildland Fire Smoke Exposure Among Farmworkers and Other Outdoor Workers, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) has reviewed the draft rule and solicited input from its over 3600 members to inform the comments provided here.
CSTE is an organization of member states and territories representing all states and territories and over 3,600 applied public health epidemiologists. CSTE’s mission is to advance the field of applied epidemiology to maximize health. CSTE promotes effective use of epidemiologic data to guide public health practice and improve health, and strengthen epidemiologic capacity, resources, and scientifically based policy.
Public health action by CSTE member states has led to improvements in clinical practice, medical procedures, surveillance, detection and control of public health threats, including the ongoing development of evidence based occupational health surveillance practices, environmental containment, and disease control policies. CSTE supports the Occupational Health Surveillance Subcommittee, representing the 22 state NIOSH-funded State Occupational Safety and Health Surveillance Programs as well as Occupational Health members in states not currently funded by NIOSH.
CSTE greatly appreciates the opportunity to comment on the NIOSH draft Hazard Review and strongly supports NIOSH’s efforts to protect outdoor workers from exposure to smoke from wildland fires. CSTE submits the following comments (see attached pages) regarding NIOSH’s draft Hazard Review (CDC- NIOSH Document Draft 08-23-2024) and appreciates your thoughtful consideration of these comments.

Given several approaches and that other workers can intermittently be exposed to wildland fires, CSTE recommends that NIOSH clarify their definition of outdoor worker as persons working a significant amount of time outdoors as part of their routine work activities and include other examples of how outdoor workers are defined (as listed above).
NIOSH’s method to define outdoor occupations is one of many population-based approaches, and jurisdictions may use other approaches. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CSTE developed a matrix to assess the degree to which a person in a given non-healthcare occupation may work indoors and outdoors. The matrix was created using several questions from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET). It resulted in 117 Standard Occupation Codes (SOC) - job titles characterized as “often outdoors” to “primarily outdoors” representing 11% of the U.S. workforce (excluding healthcare).[3] Other outdoor definitions taken from O*NET use the inverse of the reported frequency of working in indoor environmentally-controlled settings. [4] Jurisdictions, such as New York City, have relied on the Occupational Requirements Survey for information about outdoor work and identified gig workers, independent contractors and day laborers as working outdoors.

CSTE recommended assessing worker populations using the tools mentioned above. However, assumptions about risk must be explicit. Outdoor workers as defined by these approaches may not include workers who can be exposed to wildfires such as nursing assistants and aides evacuating people from assisted living facilities as O*NET and the Occupational Requirements Survey assume outdoor presence as part of usual work duties.

CSTE recommends that NIOSH add a statement about how temporary workers, like independent contractors, may have limited access to safety resources, training, and knowledge of the workers compensation processes due to their employment status. [6, 7] For example, New York City recommended that the City could partner with labor organizations to distribute personal protective equipment to workers without traditional employers.

General Comments:
As mentioned above within Chapter 2 comments, public health surveillance is a population-based, public health strategy that can help protect workers and mitigate climate-related hazards. [1] CSTE recommends expanding the language in the rule to include surveillance methods – hazard surveillance, which can assess who may be at risk of wildland fire smoke exposure, and health surveillance which can assess potential health impacts. There is no single data source that can identify all work-related injuries and illnesses. Multiple data sources are often needed, and jurisdictions need to identify the data sources they can access to recognize work-related health risks. Common data sources include syndromic surveillance, death record data, emergency and hospital discharge data, and workers’ compensations claims. CSTE has compiled information on surveillance methods and data sources within the document Occupational Health Surveillance for Tracking Climate Related Health Impacts on Workers: Heat, Wildfires, and Floods.

Limited data are available on worker populations, as noted by NIOSH.

We recommend that NIOSH add these two papers as references (Fitzsimmons et al. and Cabral and Dillender) which focus on wildfire smoke exposures as described herein. For example, Fitzsimmons et al. explored the impacts of the Canadian Wildfires among Massachusetts adults (18-64 years) who sought care for respiratory-related issues in emergency departments (ED). [8] Albeit few excess ED visits, they found Hispanic/Latino residents experienced the largest increases compared to other race/ethnicities. While not part of the NIOSH focus, Cabral and Dillender examined risk of injury in relation to wildfire smoke in workers’ compensation claims and found costs can be mitigated.

HESIS is a program that provides information to assist employers, workers, and others to prevent injury or illness from chemical hazards in the workplace and translates scientific information into practical language to provide “early warnings” to prevent work-related chronic disease.
California has experienced many of its worst wildfires in recent years due to increasingly drier, hotter climates and historic land management practices. Many workers are increasingly at risk of exposure to wildfire and wildland fire smoke exposure including those who are outdoor and others who work in locations where smoke may travel.

Surveillance was considered a key priority for addressing climate-related hazards by NIOSH. (Schulte, Bhattacharya et al. 2016) HESIS proposes the addition of a section within Chapter 2 featuring other approaches used to characterize workers or a surrogate population who may be exposed to wildland fire smoke whether outdoor or indoor as well as occupational hazard surveillance/tracking as a method to identify outdoor workers who may be exposed to wildland fire smoke. Few data are available about workers who may be exposed to wildland fire smoke and leveraging surveillance systems can offer insights – the following studies may be included. For example, Fitzsimmons et al. explored the impacts of the Canadian Wildfires among Massachusetts adults (18-64 years) who sought care for respiratory-related issues in emergency departments. (Fitzsimmons, Mahin et al. 2024) They found differences in the effects across race/ethnicity groups among adults of working age, with Hispanic/Latino residents experiencing the largest increase, albeit small in terms of excess visits. Although injury-focused and outside the current NIOSH review scope, Cabral and Dillender used measure outdoor and risk exposure derived by industry-occupation sets from workers’ compensation to assist with prioritizing higher risk from a severe injury. (Cabral and Dillender 2024) They found most smoke-induced injury increases resulted in costs that might be mitigated.",,,,,,,,general

2.2.1 - Definition and Characteristics of Outdoor Workers
HESIS proposes a modification of the term outdoor workers as persons working a significant amount of time outside a physical structure in rural, suburban, or urban areas as part of their routine work activities. Most of the characterization is about those occupations involving workers who must remain outside to finish their normal work activities and are consequently exposed to wildland fire smoke. This implies some assumptions about risk not explicitly stated e.g. the focus may be on either cumulative exposure to workers within an occupational title over a lifetime or intermittent exposures that happen as part of normal worker activities. Further, some other workers may also be exposed in the near field of a wildland fire for brief amounts of time. Nursing assistants or health aides may need to move patients during wildfires when assisted living and skilled nursing facilities need to be evacuated for example. This group of workers, also not emergency responders, would normally be considered indoor, but may be temporarily displaced from their worksite to outdoor environments and exposed to wildfire smoke.(Cabral and Dillender 2024, CSTE 2024) These intermittent exposures if occurring frequently enough may result in both acute and long-term health effects depending on the composition of the wildland fire burn mixture. Taken together, NIOSH has proposed an excellent approach to define outdoor workers; but the review requires more specificity about its outdoor worker definition and the assumptions about which workers are consider at risk.",,,,,,,,general

HESIS acknowledges NIOSH’s method to determine outdoor occupations as a sound approach for population-level assessment. However, other methods to determine outdoor workers may be included in the review. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologist (CSTE) Occupational Health Subcommittee developed a matrix to assess the degree which a person working within an occupation may be indoor and/or outdoor combined using several questions from Occupational Information Network (O*NET) resulting in 117 Standard Occupation Codes [(SOC) 2010 basis] titles considered at least often outdoors to primarily outdoors.(CSTE 2021) Other outdoor definitions taken from O*NET use the inverse of the reported frequency of working in indoor-environmentally controlled settings.(Cabral and Dillender 2024) In New York City, the Occupational Requirements Survey was used to identify outdoor workers and gig workers; independent contractors and day laborers were identified specifically using other approaches. (New York City Comptroller 2024) Lappe and Vargo assessed the impacts of wildfire smoke exposure on frontline workers in specific labor industries, including agriculture, fishing, mining, construction, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation. (Lappe and Vargo 2022) Between two five-year time periods 2011-2015 and 2017-2021, they estimated an increase of 2,132 frontline worker-days of heavy smoke exposure for California workers with overall increase of 33,522,008 person-days in 2017-2021.

While we appreciate that NIOSH is involved in initiatives to address mental health issues among workers and that this hazard review is limited to physical effects (Page 147, Lines 23-27), we think a discussion on the mental health effects will strengthen the basis for the review. Typically, mental health is seen as a separate category from physical effects, but mental health effects play a great deal in worker productivity, lost time, presenteeism, and chronic health effects. NIOSH has led in acknowledging this through their Total Worker Health™ approaches. (Schill and Chosewood 2013) There is intersectionality of these issues. Research including “The mental health and wellbeing effects of wildfire smoke: a scoping review” (Eisenman and Galway 2022) and “Wildfire smoke and symptoms affecting mental health among adults in the U.S. state of Oregon” (Mirabelli, Vaidyanathan et al. 2022) highlight this area.",,,,,,,,mental health

These occupations and associated tasks can be written into the plans in case of a wildland fire event.
Tying to the purpose outlined in Section 4.1, we recommend that NIOSH consider adding a section in Chapter 4 on vulnerability assessment of worksites or industrial complexes using quantitative methods. This area is relatively new, and while challenging, can offer some value at risk scenarios for emergency response planning for workers who are mainly in a fixed location.

4.3 – Considerations for an Exposure Assessment
HESIS recommends simplifying the tiered approach (Tiers 1, 2, and 3) presented in this section which may prove difficult for many employers to understand and implement, particularly those without in-house industrial hygiene or safety expertise. NIOSH should consider reframing the section to highlight Tier 1 data sources as the most straightforward way for employers to assess risk and make decisions about control measures to protect employees based on predefined AQI thresholds. Tier 1 should be the primary focus, with Tiers 2 and 3 presented as supplementary options for specialized circumstances/end users. Specifically, there appears to be a focus on Tier 3 assessment strategies which are rarely used in typical workplaces. Most employers will need to engage with third-party contractors who possess the knowledge and resources to conduct detailed exposure assessments of wildfire smoke constituents; this is likely not needed in most cases.",,,,,,,,exposures

5.2.2.1 Employers
To reduce barriers to understanding, we recommend that bullet point 2 - Develop a general safety and health... (Page 254, Lines 16-18) be described using examples or thought-provoking questions. For most employers, the request for hazard assessment and plans may be extremely difficult without specialized knowledge. Communication pertaining to wildfire smoke needs to be clear, specific and actionable. (Vien, Ivey et al. 2024) Illustrative examples containing key elements needed in such a plan could be included or a list of questions employers should be asking, as below:
• Who will be responsible for checking the daily AQI?
• How will the AQI be communicated to workers?
• When do workers need to protect themselves for the different AQI levels?
• What are some symptoms workers should be on the lookout for?
• If a worker experiences health effects, who should be contacted?
• What should workers who work in remote areas do?
To support community resilience, NIOSH could add that employers provide resources/literature for workers to take home to their families to also help protect them from wildfires. Some farmworkers, for example, are likely living in areas close to their work and their families could also be at risk of wildland fire smoke exposure.",,,,,,,,administrative controls

Retaliation in agriculture is well-documented. Legal services providers and other community partners regularly share incidents of workers who were fired or blacklisted because they express concerns over working conditions.

Workers are less likely to stop work, even during a wildfire, unless they are provided specific instruction by their employer. Any administrative controls, especially reductions of shifts, should be accompanied by other incentives to ensure that workers do not lose pay and are not discouraged from taking the necessary precautions to protect their health.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the Draft Hazard Review: Wildland Fire Smoke Exposure Among Farmworkers and Other Outdoor Workers. As of December 2023, Washington became the third state to enact permanent occupational safety and health rules to protect outdoor workers from wildland fire smoke. Wildfires and wildfire smoke are increasing in frequency and severity across the western U.S. As the Draft Hazard Review notes on p. 56, wildland fires account for nearly half of all PM2.5 in the western U.S.,1,2 and this is expected to substantially increase in the coming decades.3 Due to the increasing severity and widespread impact of wildfire smoke, it is imperative that NIOSH provide recommendations to protect outdoor workers from wildland fire smoke that meet the immense scale and scope of the harm.
Washington State Departments of Health (DOH) and Labor & Industries (L&I) submit the following comments in response to the Draft Hazard Review, to improve protections for outdoor workers during wildland fire smoke events. This is rooted in our scientific understanding of the health effects of wildland fire smoke exposure and informed by feedback and input we have received from public health, occupational, and air quality partners over many years of engagement:

Outdoor Workers as a Sensitive Group: In Washington State, several agencies including the Departments of Health, Ecology, and Labor & Industries classify outdoor workers as a sensitive group4,5. At the Federal Level, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)6,7 considers outdoor workers to be a sensitive group. As the Draft Hazard Review notes on page iii line 15, this designation is appropriate due to the amount of time spent outside each day and increased respiration from the often-physical labor required for outdoor work. Additionally, outdoor workers are not able to implement exposure reduction recommendations in the same way as the general public, due to the employer-controlled nature of their exposure and subsequent response. This results in a greater inhaled dose of wildfire smoke, increasing the risk of outdoor workers experiencing adverse health effects compared to the general population, regardless of the medical status of the exposed employee.

Potential health effects: Greater exposure to wildfire smoke can lead to increased risks of experiencing the range of health effects described above.”

We suggest NIOSH update the recommendations in Table 5-1 to include protections for all outdoor workers at 35.5 ?g/m3, and to add protections at levels below 35.5 ?g/m3. This is because the vast epidemiologic evidence indicates substantial health impacts at PM2.5 levels below 35.5 ?g/m3. In particular:

We recommend, at a minimum, employers provide all outdoor workers the means to follow recommendations to reduce exposure when the EPA’s Air Quality Index (AQI) category is Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (USG) or above, which starts approximately at a 1-hour average PM2.5 concentration of 35.5 ?g/m3.10 This includes implementing feasible engineering, and administrative controls, and provision of NIOSH approved respirators for employee use.

Additionally, NIOSH suggests in section 5.1.2.1 to communicate to sensitive groups.

Rather, it is appropriate for employers to apply protections to all outdoor workers simply because all outdoor workers are sensitive regardless of whether they have health conditions",,,,,,,,health equity

Linguistically and culturally relevant messaging to all employees should include information about particularly high-risk groups without targeting specific employees. Thus, all employees will be informed and can take additional precautions at lower levels of exposure if they choose. For example, the National Agricultural Workers Survey from 2019-2020 reported 68% of farmworkers indicated they could speak English “a little” or less11, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics found 25% of construction workers are foreign born12, indicating a large need for messaging in languages other than English in both industries.

Health Guidance at Lower Levels of Exposure: NIOSH asks in the Request for Public Comments “How can the recommendation in Chapter 4 to use the air quality index (AQI) for PM2.5 to define exposure control categories be better explained and supported from both a scientific and health communications standpoint? Please provide scientific evidence to support your response as necessary.”
Washington State continues to believe EPA in 2024 set the current annual and 24-hour PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) higher than the scientific basis required, given the known and ongoing harm these small particles cause.13 EPA uses these regulatory thresholds for defining the start of the “Moderate” and “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups” categories of the AQI. The method EPA uses to set the annual and 24-hour NAAQS for PM2.5 is not exclusively based on the extant scientific evidence, but instead reflects a host of other inputs that are necessarily part of the policymaking process for EPA’s regulatory purposes. We recommend NIOSH set appropriate thresholds for action for outdoor workers based first and foremost on the published epidemiologic and toxicologic evidence around health impacts of PM2.5 exposure. Specifically, we recommend health guidance and messaging begin at lower levels of exposure, rather than relying on the AQI health messages directly. Substantial epidemiologic evidence from general population studies indicates there is no safe level of exposure to PM2.5,14,15 and indeed, most adverse health outcomes occur at concentrations below what the AQI deems ‘Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups’.16

Thus, we expect impacts on outdoor workers to be greater than the epidemiologic evidence for the general public suggests, highlighting the need for guidance, requirements, and exposure reduction steps below the USG threshold of 35.5 ?g/m3. We recommend NIOSH adopt exposure thresholds that reflect the epidemiologic evidence and the fact that outdoor workers are exposed to wildfire smoke for far longer periods than the general population.

For example, L&I’s Wildfire Smoke rule requires training, and a written wildfire smoke response plan before employees are exposed to a PM2.5 of 20.5 ?g/m3, which is in the Moderate AQI category. At PM2.5 concentrations between 20.5 and 35.5 ?g/m³, L&I’s rules recommend, but do not require employers to provide respirators and to implement feasible engineering and administrative controls. L&I’s 20.5 ?g/m3 threshold is based on the Washington Air Quality Advisory (WAQA),17 which was previously used in Washington instead of the AQI, as it more directly aligned with the epidemiologic evidence on the health impacts of PM2.5.18 Under the WAQA, 20.5 ?g/m3 was the threshold between Moderate and USG. However, there is still harm below this threshold, as referenced above, substantial epidemiologic evidence from general population studies indicates there is no safe level of exposure to PM2.5.

Guidance for Co-Exposures: NIOSH asks whether “...the recommendations in Chapter 5 adequately address the protection of potentially disadvantaged or at-risk outdoor workers, such as persons with pre-existing health conditions (e.g., asthma, cardiovascular disease), migrant workers, persons of lower socioeconomic status, and elderly or minor workers? If not, how could the recommendations be changed to better protect these populations? Are there additional recommendations to consider to protect these at-risk workers?”
While we consider all outdoor workers to be at-risk from wildfire smoke, we recommend NIOSH strengthen the recommendations in the Hazard Review to better address the needs of disadvantaged or especially at-risk outdoor workers. In our changing climate, people are increasingly exposed to several hazards at the same time. This is especially true for outdoor workers, who are often exposed to compounding climate and weather extremes,19 in addition to workplace-specific exposures, and infectious disease. This increases the risk of poor outcomes in wildfire-smoke-exposed outdoor workers, consistent with their class-wide status as a “sensitive group”. We suggest NIOSH add to the recommendations in Chapter 5, including in the employee training section, information related to the heightened health risks of co-exposure, and how to protect outdoor workers who are exposed to multiple hazards including, but not limited to: wildfire smoke, heat, and infectious disease (including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza). Specific guidance for co-exposures is important, as the epidemiologic literature indicates exposure to two hazards is often worse than the sum of each individual hazard. In other words, during a simultaneous wildfire smoke and heat event, for example, evidence indicates people experience symptoms at lower levels, and/or experience worse symptoms than if they had only been exposed to one hazard alone.20 Guidance on heat co-exposures is particularly important absent federal heat rules and specific training and protections related to heat exposure in many states. Because the AQI does not contemplate combined risks in this way, addressing co-exposures, including heat and infectious diseases, would also be helpful information for this population of workers when considering the unmodified risk categories and health messaging communications of the AQI.

1. Averaging Times: Section 1.4.3.4, and throughout the draft hazard review, NIOSH references the “AQI” and the “AQI for PM2.5” both as used by EPA in relation to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and public health communication, and as thresholds for occupational health standards in states such as California, Oregon, and Washington. The draft hazard review does not differentiate between the three variants
of the AQI: The AQI forecast (prospective only), the retrospective daily AQI (24-hour average), and the NowCast AQI, which while also retrospective has a shorter averaging time between 3 and 12 hours21. We recommend NIOSH specify the time averaging intended throughout the Hazard Review such as the NowCast AQI for PM2.5 for use in occupational exposure thresholds, or the 24-hour average AQI used for ambient air quality standards. We are unaware of any AQI variant that is constructed on the basis of one-hour time-averaged mass concentrations of PM2.5, and recommend NIOSH review and edit the Hazard Review to avoid implying equivalence between the NowCast AQI and instantaneous or time-averaged mass concentrations of PM2.5 that use something other than EPA’s NowCast time-averaging algorithm.

Basis of Washington Wildfire Smoke Rule: In section 1.4.3.3, and throughout the draft hazard review, NIOSH incorrectly states that the Washington Wildfire Smoke rules are “linked to levels of EPA’s AQI for PM2.5”. This is untrue as the thresholds in the Washington rule are tied directly to the 1-hour average PM2.5 concentrations. The rule lists the NowCast AQI for PM2.5 thresholds that employers are permitted to use as approximations of the rule’s PM2.5 thresholds, consistent with EPA’s position that the agency declines to provide guidance for regulatory use of the AQI, for the AQI was not developed to be a regulatory tool22. The NowCast AQI for PM2.5 is not equivalent to the 1-hour average PM2.5 that forms the basis of the Washington Wildfire Smoke rules due to the differences in averaging times. This became especially relevant after the EPA updated the AQI breakpoints in May of 2024, as the AQI values in the Washington Wildfire Smoke rules needed to be updated to reflect the change. We request that NIOSH correct the draft hazard review to state that the Washington Wildfire Smoke rule thresholds are based on 1-hour average PM2.5.

AQI Threshold: In section 1.4.3.3, and 5.2.3, NIOSH incorrectly states that the lowest AQI threshold that requires employers to take action in Washington is 69. The Washington Wildfire Smoke rules are based on a 1-hour average PM2.5, and the lowest threshold is 20.5 ?g/m³. This approximately corresponds to a NowCast AQI for PM2.5 of 72 as an approximation of this threshold under the revised EPA AQI23.

PM2.5 and Particulates not otherwise regulated (PNOR): Section 1.5 notes that L&I contrasted the existing occupational health standards for particulates not otherwise regulated (PNOR), with the hazard of PM2.5. The section goes on to state that the only difference between the two is the size fraction. While this is true when considering only the definitions of PM2.5 and respirable fraction in isolation, average outdoor PM2.5 was only found to exceed 20.4 ?g/m³ due to wildfire smoke during the wildfire season in Washington State.24. Washington's rule uses PM2.5 as a proxy measurement for wildfire smoke with the understanding that outdoor PM2.5 at the concentrations in the rule can be assumed to contain wildfire smoke even without a component analysis. Even though wildfire smoke does not have a permissible exposure limit (PEL) under Washington’s airborne contaminants rule, PM2.5 does not meet the definition of ""nuisance dust” or “inert dust” in WAC 296-841-099, and thus the corresponding permissible exposure limit of 5000 ?g/m³ is not applicable to PM2.5.
Washington’s rule does differ from the Federal OSHA rule in that the PNOR category specifically does not apply when an airborne contaminant requires a lower permissible exposure limit (PEL), even if a lower PEL is not listed, and we request that NIOSH modify the draft document25 to reflect these differences in the discussion that cites Washington’s Air Contaminants rules.26 As the L&I Wildfire Smoke Rule Cost Benefit Analysis states “Given the diverse array of adverse health effects caused by PM2.5 exposure from wildfire smoke, this regulatory threshold [of 5000 ?g/m³] is not appropriate to address the hazard caused by particulate pollution from wildfire smoke”.27

Evidence suggests that substantial leakage occurs in the absence of fit testing,28 and a National Academies report entitled ‘Frameworks for Protecting Workers and the Public from Inhalation Hazards’, indicates that “users who are unable to perform respirator fit testing should expect lower respirator performance relative to the devices’ use in an RPP that includes fit testing.”29 Thus, we suggest NIOSH include a recommendation that employers provide access to fit testing for those employees who wish to voluntarily wear tight-fitting respirators. This would help ensure respirators fit properly when voluntarily worn, and it would also increase the availability of fit testing services for non-occupationally exposed outdoor individuals who similarly need fit testing for their respirators to work reliably. Making fit testing more widely available when respirators are voluntarily worn, especially in outdoor work settings, will improve health for all, not just for those occupationally exposed.

The following comments are provided by individuals with expertise in the occupational safety and health programs from across the two partnering organizations (DOI and USFS) within the federal government. Both organizations have a strong interest in the topic as they support both the wildland firefighter community and have numerous employees performing work outdoors beyond the firefighting functions. These comments are considered technical and are not necessarily the official opinion of the organization’s leadership and are not wholly inclusive in that there may be others contributing their own comments from DOI or USFS as they see fit. COMMENTS:
1) The task of developing this hazard review was extremely complex and the individuals that were able to review it were deeply impressed with the level of effort and analysis that went into the document, especially given the short amount of time the development was done in.

Its makes sense that those were used as the necessary foundation. What we struggle to support is the seeming efforts to solidify this use as a legitimate standard (Page 201, Line 12, for example) vs. simply accepting that these are the tools we have at hand and that this is a guide on how to use those tools in a practical way. Prefer more of a direct, upfront statement that we will use these practical tools but want to pursue research goals that will enable occupational health practitioners to better protect our population with a smoke specific metrics and an understanding of health risks associated with those specific metrics. For example, one limitation is that most smoke particles, by a count, are in the ultrafine range which is not well represented in a sample measured by mass and thus inducing potential error in both research of health effects and in exposure monitoring for health protection. A metric better than a mass measurement that is likely to include significant quantities of non-smoke particles in it is ultimately preferred.",,,,,,,,exposures

As you know, the International Safety Equipment Association (ISEA) is the association in the US for companies that design, test, manufacture and supply a wide range of PPE and safety equipment. Included in ISEA membership are respiratory protective device manufacturers and suppliers. Many ISEA members are respiratory protection approval holders.
ISEA believes that NIOSH-rated respiratory protection should be recommended for those who must work in areas affected by wildfire smoke. The report, and existing research, points to a significant mix of respirable toxins in wildfire smoke.
ISEA is pleased to offer the following comments.",,,,,,,,comment only

The report notes that some individuals report a wide range of responses to wearing a respirator including (1) air hunger, (2) headache, (3) thermal discomfort, (4) dry mouth, (5) claustrophobia, and (6) anxiety.
Through the COVID-19 pandemic, the public has become accustomed to wearing respiratory protection. In addition, the N95 designation and the value N95 respirators offer is well known.
In 2023 and 2024 (link) smoke from wild fires in Canada drifted to the East Coast. Millions of Americans experienced for the first time the threat of inhaling toxic wildfire smoke. As information about the hazards of breathing wildfire smoke become available, ISEA believes these health concerns plus the wide experience wearing masks during COVID will pave the way for mask use during wildfire smoke exposures.
Furthermore, the psychosocial aspects of respirator use as noted in Sec. 5.1.3.5 should not be allowed to negate respirator use as a component of a national response to wildfire smoke, especially for outdoor workers. In fact, 50 million Americans wear respirators as part of their jobs. This substantial number clearly demonstrates many are able to wear an N95 respirator and conduct their jobs, presumably without the subjective experiences listed in Sec. 5.1.3.5.
The items listed in this section should not prevent or limit NIOSH from recommending outdoor workers wear respirators to protect themselves from wildfire smoke inhalation hazards.",,,,,,,,ppe

The California Department of Industrial Relations website for Protecting Outdoor Workers Exposed to Smoke from Wildfires tell employers to “Protect Workers if the Outside Air is Harmful.” If the Air Quality Index is 151 or greater (""unhealthy"") and where the employer should reasonably anticipate that employees may be exposed to wildfire smoke. In these cases, DIR recommends employers provide employees with “proper respiratory protection equipment, such as disposable filtering facepiece respirators…”1 (emphasis added)
Washington State’s Department of Labor and Industry has successive requirements for employers to protect employees from wildfire smoke. When the AQI index reaches 101, employers must make N95 respirators available to employees. More stringent requirements are triggered as the AQI deteriorates (gets higher). (emphasis added).

Agricultural workers who mix and apply pesticides, likely already have experience using respirators at work. 40 CFR 1702 lists the protective requirements to protect those who mix, load and apply pesticides. There are a number of respiratory protection requirements to prevent inhalation hazards. For this set of agricultural workers, respiratory protection is already part of their workplace routine and culture.

On behalf of the undersigned public health, medical and nursing organizations, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on NIOSH’s draft “Hazard Review: Wildland Fire Smoke Exposure Among Farmworkers and Other Outdoor Workers (Hazard Review).” Wildland fire smoke poses an increasingly frequent and severe threat to everyone’s health, especially the health of outdoor workers who are on the frontlines of climate-related disasters. Robust federal guidance and protections are needed to safeguard outdoor workers from the impacts of wildland fire smoke. We appreciate NIOSH’s swift effort to create this valuable resource to protect the health and well-being of outdoor workers.

1. Modify the “Plain Language Summary” to include key exposure control recommendations. The Plain Language Summary on page xi includes important information on the composition of wildland fire smoke, the health effects of exposure and the hierarchy of controls. However, the section titled “Recommendations and conclusions” could be more useful if it summarized the information in Section 5.2 “Control Recommendations Based Upon Exposure.” A summary could include information on the Air Quality Index (AQI) breakpoints and the following key recommendations:
• Preparation, including a workplace safety and health program.
• Training before the AQI becomes unhealthy for workers.
• Engineering Controls to mitigate exposures, including enclosed structures with filtered air.
• Administrative Controls when engineering controls are not feasible, including relocating or rescheduling work, reducing physical activity, more frequent breaks, and moving duties indoors.
• Personal Protective Equipment, such as N95 respirators, when engineering and administrative controls do not sufficiently reduce exposures.",,,,,,,,general

Make the “Recommendations for Employers, Workers, and Healthcare Professionals” the first chapter of the Hazard Review.

3. Make clear that employers should communicate hazards and provide training materials in a language, or languages, and at a literacy level each employee understands. For hazards and training materials to be communicated effectively, employers must ensure that all employees are able to understand, taking into account varying education levels, literacy, and language skills. This should be reiterated in Section 5.2.1 “Basis for the NIOSH Recommendations” and Section 5.2.2 “NIOSH Recommendations for Employers, Workers, and Healthcare Professionals” of the Hazard Review. In addition, trainings should provide employees an opportunity for questions and answers about the materials.",,,,,,,,administrative controls

Recommend workplace trainings include training on workers’ rights. The only mention of workers’ rights in the Hazard Review is on page 255, which recommends workers “know the rules and regulations to safely perform your job and who to contact with any concerns.” This places the burden of knowledge on the worker. However, it should be the employer’s responsibility to include information about workplace rights in training materials. It is important workers are made aware of their rights, especially considering lack of employer compliance with respiratory protection programs is a known barrier to effective use of respiratory protective devices.2 The Hazard Review should specify in Section 5.1.2.2 that trainings should also include information for how sensitive groups can protect their health, including people with respiratory or cardiovascular disease, pregnant people, children under 18 years old and older adults.",,,,,,,,administrative controls

We appreciate that NIOSH recommends employers implement exposure controls for sensitive groups at an AQI of 101 or above (considered unhealthy for sensitive groups) and for all groups at an AQI of 151 or above (considered unhealthy for everyone). The current AQI breakpoints reflect the annual national ambient air quality standard for PM2.5 of 9 ?g/m3 and the 24-hour standard of 35 ?g/m3. However, the Lung Association and other health organizations have called for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to strengthen the annual standard to 8 ?g/m3 and the 24-hour standard to 25 ?g/m3 based on what the latest science shows is necessary to protect health. Lowering the threshold for employers to implement exposure controls for sensitive groups to an AQI of 80 (equivalent to a PM2.5 concentration of 25.2 ?g/m3) could better protect workers’ health.",,,,,,,,exposures

Consider reframing the Hazard Review as “Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupational Exposure to Wildland Fire Smoke.” A federal wildland fire smoke standard is crucial for protecting outdoor workers across the country from the increasing impacts of wildland fire smoke. Currently only three states – California, Washington and Oregon – have a standard in place to protect outdoor workers from smoke, leaving millions of outdoor workers without protections. The Forward of NIOSH’s “Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupational Exposure to Heat and Hot Environments” states, “When the U.S. Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-596)…Congress charged NIOSH with recommending occupational safety and health standards and describing exposure levels that are safe for various periods of employment, including but not limited to the exposures at which no worker will suffer diminished health, functional capacity, or life expectancy because of his or her work experience. Criteria documents contain a critical review of the scientific and technical information about the prevalence of hazards, the existence of safety and health risks, and the adequacy of control methods.”8 The Hazard Review contains the components of a criteria document – a critical review of the scientific and technical information about the prevalence of the hazard, the safety and health risks, and the adequacy of control methods. Reframing the Hazard Review as “Criteria for a Recommended Standard” could help pave the way for OSHA to start the rulemaking process on a federal smoke standard for outdoor workers.

Alianza de Campesinas, Northwest Forest Center, Rural Coalition, and the undersigned appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the changes in regulations to the Hazard Review: Wildland Fire Smoke Exposure among Farmworkers and Other Outdoor Workers (Docket ID: CDC-2024-0065-0001) for wildland workers and farmworkers.
Alianza Nacional de Campesinas (Alianza) and Rural Coalition (RC) have worked together and alongside farmworkers for over 13 years—from the testimony we’ve delivered to Congress and federal agencies to our fights in the courts, we elevate solutions to the challenges farming communities face. Further, our organizations prioritize engaging directly with farmworkers and farming community members and center their needs and recommendations in our advocacy and outreach. We have successfully advocated for policies to increase USDA transparency and accountability, to reduce risk of land and farm loss, and to increase prosperity in the food system by expanding opportunities and access to agricultural programs for the nation’s diverse farmers and farmworkers. Currently, we are in a supportive role with USDA in the delivery of their Food and Farmworker Relief Program which reimburses food workers and farm workers for up to $600 in cost of protection from the COVID-19 pandemic authorized in laws passed in the last three years, among other efforts specifically addressing BIPOC and women' s rights.
The Northwest Forest Worker Center has also been a long-term partner of the Rural Coalition. We have collaborated on educating policy makers and agency officials about the forest restoration workforce and the challenges forest workers face. We have also worked together in crafting specific recommendations for improving working conditions and enhancing the safety and health of these workers and presented them to members of Congress and USDA and Forest Service officials.
The focus of our Center for Disease Control (CDC) comments is based on question/s 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 in the federal register notice. Below are our collective responses and recommendations on the NIOSH Hazard Review released by CDC.",,,,,,,,comment only

How could the outdoor worker populations who may be exposed to wildland fire smoke be more completely characterized in Chapter 2? Please provide supporting references.
Chapter 2 provides a list of employment by outdoor occupations providing findings from 2023 showing 132 outdoor occupations and 20 million outdoor jobs.1 One of the larger groups of outdoor workers is “farming, fishing, and forestry” making up 4.6% of outdoor workers.2 Further, the estimated employment in farmworker occupations is estimated as less than one million jobs.3 This number highly underestimates the number of farmworker jobs. The hazard review cites a few different data sets: the Current Population Survey (CPS), Bureau of Labor Statistics Projected Employment Program (BLS), and the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Between the data from these three sources, NIOSH estimates that there are between 800,000 and 1.5 million farmworkers.4 However, there are several sources we recommend NIOSH to consider as well as encourage interagency collaboration to improve these surveys to better inform Hazard Reviews produced to protect workers.
Firstly, the USDA NASS conducts the Census of Agriculture, which provides both data and analysis on farms and ranches across the country, as well as the people who operate them, including farmworkers. The most recent Census published in February 2024 is the 2022 Census, which estimates that there are 2.1 million farmworkers, a significantly higher number than what is referenced in the Hazard Review.5

How can the recommendation in Chapter 4 to use the air quality index (AQI) for PM 2.5 to define exposure control categories be better explained and supported from both a scientific and health communications standpoint? Please provide scientific evidence to support your response as necessary.
Chapter 4’s Community-Based Monitors section provides an in depth description on the various types of monitors or monitoring methods.19 However, the data or results from these monitors are often not reaching outdoor farmworkers who live in areas where they are susceptible to wildland smoke exposure. One of Alianza’s organizers based in Southern California, an area that battles wild fires often, shared that many farmworkers do not receive alerts from employers and learn about air quality news or alerts through their children’s schools. Additionally, the consumer networked particulate matter monitors such as PurpleAir Network are not consistent or reliable for some outdoor farmworkers who do not have reception at their worksites.
Additionally, our partners Lideres Campesinas in Ventura County, California shared about a new pilot program to alert on smoke and wildfire hazards and emergencies, which has reached farmworkers across various worksites in the county. The Ventura County Air Pollution Control District launched the first Farmworker Smoke Alert Text System and recently implemented a pilot program of this system.20 This system sends alerts via text or audio when the AQI reaches unhealthy levels of 151. The system responds to subscribers in both English and Spanish, however, Lideres Campesinas did receive some concerns from farmworkers and community members during the last alert, such as some people not getting the alert on time and continued working through unhealthy AQI levels for hours.
Our partners in Sonoma County, report that outdoor farmworkers use other sources, but these do not specifically measure the AQI. Some farmworkers use SocoAlert and Nixle, but these two require a subscription and registration prior to receiving any alerts.21 Other alert and warning systems that do not require a subscription in advance to receive alerts are Hi-Lo Sirens, Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), and Emergency Alert Systems (EAS). Generally, we recommend that any monitoring system, network, or program should keep in mind some challenges to address so that these systems and data are communicated effectively to outdoor farmworkers. Specifically, regarding phone technology, phone accessibility and reception during work, receiving input from the community and workers, as well as acquiring trust in the community to actually subscribe to the application alerts.
Forest workers are in a position similar to farmworkers in that they do not always have immediate access to current information about air quality. This is exacerbated by the fact that they often work in remote areas where they do not have cell phone coverage or internet access.
Even if they can access websites like airnow.gov on their cell phones, the closest air quality monitors to where they are working may be tens of miles, or even over 100 miles, away. At such worksites, the best available option for assessing air quality at any given moment (as winds change and smoke clouds blow in, for example) is probably a hand held device. An added measure to ensure worker awareness of their exposure to wildland fire smoke could be to train forest workers, in a language they understand, in the use of the 5-3-1 Visibility Index.22 This is a way to estimate smoke exposure developed by Oregon’s Department of Environmental Quality. It uses visibility of distant objects, such as mountains, mesas, and other landscape features, to roughly determine the level of pollutants in the air. While such estimates are clearly subjective and not precise, they could help give forest workers a warning as to when they should have their foreman engage the hand-held device, or, if a device is not available, move to another location where the air quality is better.

Worker Education and Training
A barrier to employers implementing recommended methods is implementing linguistically and culturally appropriate and responsive methods, specifically for worker trainings. In this regard, employee trainings should take into account farmworkers’ primary languages, reading levels, and culture. There also should be evaluations of the trainings that will require spaces where workers can share lessons that they have learned. These spaces, moreover, should be clean and adequate for workers to learn from one another and the trainers. Farmworker and forest worker input should also be part of evaluations that could be incorporated into future trainings. Special attention should be paid to training the trainers as well so that they have the required cultural competency, as well as level of expertise. Community health workers (promotoras de salud) have been shown to be effective in providing culturally appropriate, in-language occupational safety and health training to forest workers,23 as well as to farmworkers, particularly when the workers participate in the development of the trainings.24 Having community health workers train workers in mitigating their exposure to wildland fire smoke could help improve the effectiveness and remove barriers to implementation of the recommendations in Chapter 5.

A great deal of peer-reviewed research has demonstrated that forest restoration workers typically do not receive adequate training.25 Despite the safety requirements in federal and state laws, forestry services contractors often do not provide training to their employees. This is unwarranted in such a hazardous industry in which, in Oregon for example, job-related injury and illness rates are 3 times as high as they are for the average worker and fatality rates are 9 times as high.26

352-A Submission through Regulations.gov from Alianza Nacional de Campesinas 1-10-2025,,,,,1/10/2025,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Alianza Nacional de Campesinas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"One way to address the inadequate training of forest restoration workers is to direct the USDA Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to require forest restoration contractors to demonstrate and certify at pre-award inspections that their crew members have received adequate training, including safety training, in the knowledge and skills necessary to perform their job duties. Under current agency practice, this is required of vendors seeking wildland firefighting contracts, but it is not required of vendors seeking labor intensive service contracts to do fuels-reduction or pre-commercial thinning, or other types of vegetation management.
Including such a requirement in labor intensive service contracts would help assure that forest restoration workers receive the training that is already required under state and federal law. Federal law as well as the laws of the states of Oregon and Washington require that each employer “shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees” (29 USC §654.5(a)(1)). Oregon law specifically requires employers or their authorized representative to “provide job safety and health instruction and training to current and new employees, including supervisors, that is adequate for the work task” (OAR 437-007-0140(1)).

Federal service contracts include clauses that require compliance with all applicable labor laws, including those that require training. Requiring contractors to show that they have provided training to their crews at pre-award inspections would help assure compliance with the terms of their contracts as well as with applicable labor laws.

It is well within the Forest Service’s authority to conduct pre-award inspections. Federal Acquisition Regulations state: “The Government has the right to inspect and test all services called for by the contract, to the extent practicable at all times and places during the term of the contract” (FAR 52.246-4(c) (Aug. 1996)).

Current Forest Service practice is to conduct pre-award inspections of wildland firefighting contractor crews and equipment. The contracts wildland firefighting contractors enter into specify the qualifications of the personnel who will work on fire suppression under the contract. Employers are required to have their employees’ training records verified. It is their responsibility to work with a records verification provider to have that verification done. They must present the resulting documentation at the pre-award inspection to demonstrate that their crews meet the training requirements for their respective positions.

In contrast, forest restoration contractors seeking labor intensive service contracts to do pre-commercial or fuels-reduction thinning, pesticide application or other vegetation management are under no such obligations. The nature of the work their crews do—operating chainsaws, felling trees, clearing brush, applying pesticides—is very similar to the work Firefighters 1 and 2 (FFT1 And FFT2) and Incident Sawyers do in fighting wildland fires. Firefighters and forestry services workers also face many of the same workplace hazards: exposure to wildland fire smoke, chainsaw kickback, falling trees and branches, exposure to extreme heat, exposure to dangerous chemicals, to name a few. Despite the similarities between the work and hazards in wildland firefighting and forest restoration, contractors in the forest restoration industry are not required to demonstrate that they have provided their crews with safety and health training adequate to their tasks. Requiring them to do so would help improve employer compliance with safety and health training regulations.",,,,,,,,administrative controls

We find the discussion of work intensity and smoke inhalation a little vague in section 5.1.2.8.

One specific concern we have is the impact of long-term and chronic exposure to wildfire smoke, including from toxic chemicals from the burning of any plastics that may be found in debris in the wildlands. This exposure can also affect pregnancy and the fetus both short-term and long-term. Accordingly, we would like greater specificity in this section as to employers’ responsibilities to their workers in particular conditions. For instance, that extended break and rest times are offered for piece workers, we would like to see assurances that they will not be pushed to work more than what is expected. We find it crucial to consider the extreme pressure that farmworkers face to complete their work despite hazardous work conditions.28

Do the recommendations in Chapter 5 adequately address the protection of potentially disadvantaged or at-risk outdoor workers, such as persons with pre-existing health conditions ( e.g., asthma, cardiovascular disease), migrant workers, persons of lower socioeconomic status, and elderly or minor workers? If not, how could the recommendations be changed to better protect these populations? Are there additional recommendations to consider to protect these at-risk workers?
The recommendations in Chapter 5 do not adequately address common health hazards and the protections necessary for at-risk outdoor workers. We agree that it is essential for employers to prepare workers for wildland fire smoke exposure, as stated in Section 5.1.2.1, but believe there are missing considerations in identifying sensitive populations, providing communication methods, and establishing control methods. In terms of one of the listed sensitive populations, outdoor workers, specifically rural farmworkers, are often and consistently exposed to pesticides. This exposure places outdoor farmworkers at an increased risk of developing respiratory, cardiovascular, dementia, and other diseases that render them especially susceptible to the adverse effects of wildland fire smoke.31 We believe exposure to pesticides and herbicides should be listed as an identifier for a “sensitive population.” Including workers exposed to pesticides as a sensitive population is essential, especially for farmworkers, who are at risk of miscarriages, premature delivery, infertility, or developing a fetus with birth defects32 and the combination of pesticide and smoke exposure could heighten the impact of the other. Additionally, there are many farmworkers who experience chronic smoke exposure. Our partner in Florida, the Farmworker Association of Florida, shares that there is a large number of farmworkers in the pine straw harvest industry. These farmworkers do the pine straw harvesting with many of the same problems and conditions as farmworkers everywhere but are exposed to smoke from forest fires for long periods of time. They rake the pine needles in forests and collect them for bundling to be sold for mulch, which is very labor intensive work. Chronic smoke exposure should be a sensitive population category because it is more specific than ‘outdoor workers.’

Migrant farmworker housing is typically on or near the fields they work in. These housing accommodations are often substandard, leading to overcrowded housing with poor insulation.33 As a result, migrant farmworker housing is often inadequately equipped to handle smoke infiltration. For farmworkers who don’t live in migrant worker housing or other employer provided housing, they also often live near their workplaces, as well as send their children to daycare and school in the surrounding areas. The National Housing Law Project (NHLP) has emphasized the importance of adequate housing protections to mitigate environmental risks for vulnerable populations, including migrant workers.
34 Minimum housing standards that protect against wildfire smoke, such as insulated windows and doors, mandatory air filtration systems, and air quality monitoring, should be prioritized for communities that are especially vulnerable to wildland fire and smoke. We recommend that this hazard review incorporate the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) suggestion to designate community shelters that have advanced filtration systems, as well as emergency resources for affected community members.35

States like California employ incarcerated individuals to perform firefighter duties for less than $1 per hour, with no access to workers’ compensation, disability insurance, or health insurance.36 The disparity between firefighters and their incarcerated counterparts renders “inmate firefighters” at a heightened susceptibility to immediate and long-term health effects due to smoke exposure. This is an especially relevant to NIOSH’s Hazard Review because in some states prison inmates comprise a significant proportion of the wildland firefighting workforce. In California, for example, they account for 30% of all wildland firefighters.37",,,,,,,,health equity

In addition to ensuring the communication is language inclusive, it should also be provided on a regular basis, preferably more than once a year since outdoor farmworkers may migrate, change worksite or employer, or have different vulnerabilities during times of the year. Further, the American Public Health Association (APHA) highlights the importance of health education that appropriately meets the needs of vulnerable populations in mitigating the impact of environmental hazards.38 Therefore, we recommend that the recommendations consider the collaboration between employers and local health service departments in order to prepare farmworkers and their families with detailed information. Lastly, any communication to workers should clearly state and convey that workers can make questions or exercise the preparedness plan, without retaliation.

We recommend that these plans include instruction on how to seek medical care if they experience illness or medical needs due to wildfire smoke and where to seek medical care, keeping in mind that the majority of farmworkers do not have health insurance, many may not speak English, and many would be considered low income or even in poverty. For many, their only medical attention is from migrant health centers or mobile clinics. In 2020, the Department of Labor’s National Agricultural Workers Survey found that 52% of farmworkers lack access to adequate health insurance,39 compounding this risk due to unaddressed underlying conditions and increasing likelihood of long-term health effects as a result of smoke exposure. Outdoor workers without health insurance should also be considered a “sensitive population” in this chapter.

How could the recommendations in Chapter 5 better address accessibility and feasibility for outdoor workers and employers?
We would like to emphasize that farmworkers and forest workers, within the hierarchy of controls, are uniquely exposed to workplace dangers. There is no possibility for eliminating risks, as well as substituting them, as work sites are located outside. Compounding this fact is the reality that many workers are precarious given a lack of legal status, or status as nonimmigrants with easily revoked H-2A or H-2B visas, and poverty. Making accessible PPE and other items that would mitigate the harm of exposure, accordingly, is needed, but difficult to ensure because many workers also lack the power to raise complaints for fear of reprisal.",,,,,,,,health equity

On page 11 of our comment, we shared that about 52% of farmworkers do not have health insurance, making prevention versus response key to protecting workers from smoke exposure illness and injury.

What other research needs should be considered in addition to those included in Chapter 6, Research Needs? Please provide a scientific justification for additional research needs.
As stated in Chapter 6 of the hazard review, there is evidence of health risks from exposure but not as much information on factors that may modify causal relationships such as pesticides and smoke or chemicals from plastics and smoke. We believe research on the impact of multiple occupational hazards needs to be prioritized, as that is the reality for many outdoor workers, especially farmworkers and forestry workers.",,,,,,,,research needs

Additionally, while some workers are piece rate workers, and employers may push workers too hard in inhospitable conditions, we would like to note that the pace of work must also be examined.43
